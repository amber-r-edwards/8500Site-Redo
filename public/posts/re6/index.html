        <h1>RE6 - Critical Reading(s)</h1>
        <img src="/GreatMeadow.jpg" alt="cover of The Great Meadow, by Brian Donahue" style="width:350px; float:left">
            <p>This week we’re looking at reviews, for which I chose a book for my Spatial History class, The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord.
                 Having already reviewed this work in contrast with corresponding articles and digital projects, I was curious to see what other thought of it closer to the time it came out.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I found the work well constructed, and a pivotal development in spatial history as it pertains to using digital methods that allow the natural environment to have a voice in its own historical narrative.
                 Similar to incorporating the voices of marginalized groups, by including the ecological development of the land itself Donahue was able to construct a thorough and convincing argument that English settlers maintained sustainable mixed husbandry practices for generations before a gradual slip into exhaustive use of the land took over in alignment with growing population and market demands.
                 This is contrary to the common historical narrative aided by the Transcendentalists of the early colonies as having destroyed the land in original settlements before expanding west and continuing the practice – and was made possible by mapping patters and cycles of land use via GIS.</p>
            <br>
            <p>First, let’s consider the sources of these reviews.
                 All of these were found via the Clemson Library online database and are peer-reviewed journals: <em>Environmental History</em>, <em>The Journal of American History</em>, <em>American Historical Review</em>, and <em>Journal of Historical Geography</em>.</p>
            <br>
                <ul>
                 <li><strong><em>Environmental History Journal</em></strong> is published quarterly by the University of Chicago Press on behalf of the American Society for Environmental History and the Forest History Society.</li>
                 <li><strong><em>The Journal of American History</em></strong> is published quarterly by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Organization of American Historians.</li>
                 <li><strong><em>The American Historical Review</em></strong> is the official publication of the American Historical Association (AHA) and was chartered by Congress in 1889 to serve the interests of the entire discipline of history.</li>
                 <li><strong><em>The Journal of Historical Geography</em></strong> is published quarterly by Elsevier and is labeled as a sub-disciplinary journal.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Each of these have a historical audience, but Environmental History and Journal of Historical Geography may also have an audience of academics outside of history – geographers, political scientists with an environmental focus, etc. I do not see this book as a popular history due to his extensive description of both the ecology of the land – stemming from his own experience as a farmer – and the belaboring process of looking at multigenerational uses of the land.
                 While his narrative is well crafted and engaging, it is certainly not geared toward a non-academic audience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Second, let’s consider the reviewers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Environmental History Journal</em> chose <strong>Richard Judd</strong> to review this book in July 2005, he was/is a Professor at University of Maine focused on US History – specifically urban, economic, and industrial history. He had multiple publications out prior to this review including 4 books on environmental history of New England, for example, <em>Common Lands, Common People: The Origins of Conservation in Northern New England</em>. (Harvard University Press, 1997).</li>
                    <li><em>The Journal of American History</em> chose <strong>Virginia DeJohn Anderson</strong>, Professor at Colorado University Boulder in Early America. Her publications included <em>Creatures of Empire: How Domestic Animals Transformed Early America</em>. (Oxford University Press, 2004), not only also on par with Donahue in ecological concerns but also under the same publisher as the journal itself.</li>
                    <li><em>The American Historical Review</em> chose <strong>Robert Gross</strong>, History Professor at UConn focused on social and cultural US history from the colonial era through the 19th century who had published an article about Concord specifically – “Commemorating Concord: How a New England Town Invented Itself,” <em>Common-place</em> 4, no. 1 (October 2003) – as well as multiple works on the Transcendentalists.</li>
                    <li><em>The Journal of Historical Geogrpahy</em> chose <strong>Anne Kelly Knowles</strong>, a self-described historical geographer who was a professor at Middlebury College when her review was written. She was an editor for a collection of historical works on GIS – Editor, <em>Past Time, Past Place: GIS for History</em> (ESRI Press) – and has remained influential in spatial historiography.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Each of these reviews follow a very similar structure of opening with an assertion of the existing accepted historical narrative of environmental waste in colonial New England – informed by Thoreau and the Transcendentalist lamentations – before progressing into a summary of Donahue’s methods and concluding with a praise for his impactful argument on either historiography or digital expansion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Virginia DeJohn Anderson and Robert Gross each praise Donahue for his defense of early colonists and their connection to English land management systems, character of family and community, and ability to create a sustainable relationship with the nature – counter to the usual narrative of cheap land and expensive labor.
                 The generational focus of the work is central to the sustainability of the land usage, however I saw a flaw in the amount of attention (or lack of attention) paid by Donahue to women as important to the functioning dynamic.
                 But, I am a women and gender historian so that makes sense.</p>
            <br>

                <figcaption> < Anderson citing the creation of a new community grown out of English traditions</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="/GrossRight.png" alt="screenshot of Gross' review" style="width:350px; float: right">

            <br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br>
            <p>Richard Judd sees the book as a “revisionist” history and focuses inward on the implications in other colonies rather than outward on the English influence.
                 Something I noted was the importance of using scale and “zooming out” as Donahue does to consider the identities of the colonists as linked to their English origins. </p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="/JuddAlone.png" alt="screenshot of Judd's review">
                <figcaption>Emphasis on applying Donahue’s findings and methods to other colonies – not considered applicable by other reviewers due to the unique landscape of Concord formed by the glacial freeze, indigenous presence prior to the settlers, and location in relation to the river.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, Anne Kelly Knowles takes a methodological approach, praising Donahue for his use of GIS/empirical research to recast colonial New England agriculture – thus demonstrating the importance of employing GIS.
                 I agree with her regarding the necessity of GIS in his argument, as the recognition of the large scale patters would not have been achievable without the birds eye view his maps provided.</p>
            <br>
            <figure>
                <img src="/KnowlesAlone.png" alt="screenshot of Knowles' review">
                <figcaption>Focus on the geographical nature of the work – informed by his use of GIS analytics</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>
            <p>Overall these reviews were all complimentary, reflective of the impact that Donahue’s book surely had on both spatial history and the historiography of colonial New England.
                 Given their length and the fact that none of the reviewers were gender historians, I don’t find it odd that I had some different opinions/focuses – rather it is surely a product of the journal selecting authors who could be considered credible on similar topics.</p>
