        <p>Note taking is one of the most important research tools, and the first step to writing a successful argument for any length of paper. 
            My note taking style revolves around summarizing topics and arguments as well as catching any recurring themes that may be helpful to my research aims. 
            Turabian’s <em>Manual for Writers</em>breaks down what research is, how we should think of it, and how to conduct it properly in order to best articulate our argument. 
            The topic sentence breakdown of "I am working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I can help others understand Z” is something foundational that is taught in high schools and undergrad, but understanding each element will help you identify topics when reading other historians’ work. 
            Not every source you read will follow that sentence structure, not even close, but in every good argument those three elements should be present in some form. 
            I’ll also highlight any names or works that I recognize to draw connections when I put my notes into Obsidian (a note-taking software). 
            Each book I’ve read has its own page on Obsidian where I keep a quick summary, notes about the author, and tags for each theme to tie the different pages together.</p>
        <br>
            <img src="/HIS-8010-media.jpg" style="height:450px; float:left;"/>
        <p>Here is an example from <em>Ella Baker & the Black Freedom Movement</em> by Barbara Ransby taken from Chapter 1, “Now, Who Are Your People?.” 
            This was a used book, so the blue is not mine, in yellow I’ve highlighted a section that I feel is setting the context for her argument in this chapter – that the foundation of Ella Baker’s political activism and dogma was established by the black Southern Baptist community she was raised in. </p>
        <br>
        <p>After compiling notes from various sources, it’s helpful to have a method to group and sort them. Previously I’ve used a running Word Document with all citations and quotes I can piece in as needed – along with the notes I took while reading the source. 
            While this worked, I’m looking to replace it with Obsidian which will automatically group my notes with the previously mentioned tags rather than having to drag my quotes through 30+ pages on Word in order to group them. 
            In Schrag’s The Princeton Guide to Historical Research, Chapter 12 “Taking Notes” articulates methods of “mining and assembly” and a working draft to develop a more fluid narrative, all of which cannot be done without first taking good notes.</p>
