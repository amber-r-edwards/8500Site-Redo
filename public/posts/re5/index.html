        <br><br>
        <p>This week, in correlation with Clemson’s Humanities in the Machine Symposium, we’re looking at JSTOR’s beta AI tool.
             The article I chose to analyze is “Sex and the Me Decade: Sex and Dating Advice Literature of the 1970s” by Anna Ward in <em>Women’s Studies Quarterly</em> in 2015.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h4>First, I asked it to summarize the article for me:</h4></p> <br>
            <blockquote>"Here’s a summary: The 1970s saw a significant shift in sex and dating advice literature, moving away from the promotion of healthy marriages towards a focus on personal sexual satisfaction and self-exploration as critical to identity formation.
                 Feminist and LGBTQ debates and activism heavily influenced this shift, reframing sex and sexuality as fundamentally political and challenging traditional prescriptions around gender and sexual norms.
                  Advice manuals increasingly framed sexuality as a means of self-expression and authenticity, with the rise of psychology-based “sex therapy” approaches encouraging women to view sexual fulfillment as a path to empowerment in other areas of life.
                 While the 1970s advice literature was overwhelmingly focused on a white, middle-class audience, it nonetheless represented a notable shift towards greater diversity in sexual discourse and recognition of a broad range of sexual desires and needs."</blockquote>
        <br>
        <img src="/RE51.png" alt="screenshot of above text">
        <br>
        <p>Upon first glance it seems specific, however it eliminates the nuance in Ward’s argument and makes it seem that the literature moved further away from the context of marriage than the evidence showed.
             Additionally, it eliminates how Ward situated her argument in the historiography of the sexual revolution. Ward argues that the 1970s and the shift in dating and sex advice literature is directly in conversation with studies of the 1960s and the sexual revolution within that decade.
             In the 1970s we see Roe v. Wade, the ERA debate, and increasing political discourse regarding feminism and LGBTQ+ rights and discrimination.</p>
        <br>
             <p><h4>Next I asked it a few questions about the article:</h4></p> <br>
        <p>I wanted to start off with a question that addressed the gap I saw in the summary with the historiography, to see if the tool is able to articulate historiography if asked the question a different way.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong>Why does the author think the 1970s are as important as the 1960s regarding sex and gender?</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>The author believes the 1970s are as important as the 1960s regarding sex and gender for several reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>**Distinct Era of Sexual Thought**: The 1970s represented a decade of profound shifts in sexual and gender politics in the U.S., which included landmark Supreme Court cases and significant publications that shaped sexual discourse. This indicates that the 1970s had its own unique contributions to sexual thought, rather than merely being an extension of the 1960s [1, 2]</li>
                <li>**Feminist and Queer Activism**: The decade was vital for feminist and lesbian and gay inquiry into sex and sexual politics. The activism and scholarship from this period exerted considerable pressure on popular sexual discourse, highlighting the importance of the 1970s in shaping contemporary sexual politics [3, 4]</li>
                <li>**Shift in Dating and Sex Advice Literature**: The dating and sex advice literature of the 1970s is noted to have garnered significantly less attention than earlier marriage manuals, yet it played a crucial role in reflecting and influencing societal attitudes towards sex and relationships. This literature marked a shift in tone, audience, and content, indicating a growing interest in sexual knowledge beyond traditional norms [2, 5]</li>
            </ol>
            Overall, the author emphasizes that the 1970s should not be overlooked as a distinct and influential era in the context of sexual and gender politics [2]</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Again, though vague, it is fairly on par with the main arguments presented by Wade.
             If you were using the tool just to see what the quick points are you could certainly do so, and it even includes citations to where the information is pulled from – cited in brackets using the page number out of the total, rather than the accurate page numbers to the journal.
             However, you would not be able to discern what evidence is used to support her arguments through this summary.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Next, I asked a question somewhat as a ‘gimmie’ by using an exact phrase used by the author to see how it would define it and if the citation would correctly direct me to where the phrase is used.
             I intentionally did not use quotation marks.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong>What is the cult of efficiency?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong>The “cult of efficiency” refers to a pervasive theme in marital advice literature, particularly during the mid-twentieth century.
             This concept suggests that individuals are advised to prepare for sex in a manner similar to how they would prepare for a job.
              The literature emphasized the importance of sexual satisfaction as a product of learned and practiced techniques, which were facilitated by knowledge imparted by experts.
             This approach shifted the burden of achieving sexual satisfaction in marriage from husbands to wives, often drawing on Freudian-based theories of sexuality [1, 2]</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="/RE52.png" alt="screenshot of above answer">
            <figcaption>Interestingly, though one of the citations shows where the author used the phrase in the text, when you click on them, only an excerpt from the previous page is highlighted in the text and the page numbers are incorrect– perhaps part of the kinks needing to be worked out.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>Again here it takes out the specifics that women were the ones being told to prepare for sex, a key determination, instead saying “individuals” which makes it seem that the audience was broader than the white, middle class, heterosexual woman.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At current, the JSTOR AI tool is certainly useful for summarizing and quick ideas, but is not effective for specifics and you certainly wouldn’t want to take it at face value because the argument could be much more nuanced than the tool is saying.
             In my opinion this is fairly on par for what I expect from AI generated responses – hence why I don’t tend to use them.
             While I have not previously used AI tools like this in my historical work, I do think the summarizing tool is effective for quickly working through a large number of articles to identify where to focus, categorize, etc.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I were to use AI tools for writing out summaries and use it directly – or indirectly – in my work, I certainly think it is important to cite this in some manner, though I can’t say I’ve ever seen anyone actually do this.
             So, what would we cite from AI and how would we do it? 
             Schrag lists the reasons that we cite sources in Chapter 15 of <em>The Princeton Guide</em>: to attribute a quotation or claim to a particular source, to establish context in which a statement was made, to give researchers instructions on where to find the material, and/or to point the reader toward other scholarship.
             If AI has been used in the aforementioned manner, then by this definition it certainly requires citation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In searching for an answer on this, I found neither <em>The Princeton Guide</em> or Turabian able to clearly guide me.
             The closest I found was in the Turabian 15.4.1, “Sources Consulted Online” under sources unique to the medium they’re found in – requiring an access date, URL, and information about the format.
             Main issues being here that the webpage doesn’t inherently have a title other than the article’s title – or an author other than the author of the article – and the lack of explanation of what I used the tool for if not specified in the body of my work.
             However, it also asserted that online content can sometimes be equivalent to anonymous sources, “unlikely to be authoritative or reliable enough to use without serious qualification.”
             In the case of AI, how would I qualify if it is reliable enough without an understanding of the backend it is running on? This brings us to a larger question of the responsibility of historians in the digital age to have an understanding of coding, which I felt relevant to include here but will otherwise leave alone for the sake of the length of this blog post (I’ve already written enough of my thoughts in my reading reflection for this week).
             Consequently, the best I could find to a “correct” citation in this specific instance has been included below – it certainly gets the job done, but I’d argue that as more databases and tools incorporate AI into their function there certainly needs to be a regulated expectation of when and how to cite them.</p>
