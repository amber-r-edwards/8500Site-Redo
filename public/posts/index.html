<p>This week we’re looking at reviews, for which I chose a book for my Spatial History class, The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord. Having already reviewed this work in contrast with corresponding articles and digital projects, I was curious to see what other thought of it closer to the time it came out.</p>
<p>I found the work well constructed, and a pivotal development in spatial history as it pertains to using digital methods that allow the natural environment to have a voice in its own historical narrative.Similar to incorporating the voices of marginalized groups, by including the ecological development of the land itself Donahue was able to construct a thorough and convincing argument that English settlers maintained sustainable mixed husbandry practices for generations before a gradual slip into exhaustive use of the land took over in alignment with growing population and market demands. This is contrary to the common historical narrative aided by the Transcendentalists of the early colonies as having destroyed the land in original settlements before expanding west and continuing the practice – and was made possible by mapping patters and cycles of land use via GIS.</p>

    <p>This week, in correlation with Clemson’s Humanities in the Machine Symposium, we’re looking at JSTOR’s beta AI tool.</p>
<p>The article I chose to analyze is “Sex and the Me Decade: Sex and Dating Advice Literature of the 1970s” by Anna Ward in <em>Women’s Studies Quarterly</em> in 2015.</p>
<h4 id="first-i-asked-it-to-summarize-the-article-for-me">First, I asked it to summarize the article for me:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here’s a summary: The 1970s saw a significant shift in sex and dating advice literature, moving away from the promotion of healthy marriages towards a focus on personal sexual satisfaction and self-exploration as critical to identity formation.
Feminist and LGBTQ debates and activism heavily influenced this shift, reframing sex and sexuality as fundamentally political and challenging traditional prescriptions around gender and sexual norms.
Advice manuals increasingly framed sexuality as a means of self-expression and authenticity, with the rise of psychology-based “sex therapy” approaches encouraging women to view sexual fulfillment as a path to empowerment in other areas of life.
While the 1970s advice literature was overwhelmingly focused on a white, middle-class audience, it nonetheless represented a notable shift towards greater diversity in sexual discourse and recognition of a broad range of sexual desires and needs.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Note taking is one of the most important research tools, and the first step to writing a successful argument for any length of paper. My note taking style revolves around summarizing topics and arguments as well as catching any recurring themes that may be helpful to my research aims. Turabian’s Manual for Writers breaks down what research is, how we should think of it, and how to conduct it properly in order to best articulate our argument. The topic sentence breakdown of &ldquo;I am working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I can help others understand Z” is something foundational that is taught in high schools and undergrad, but understanding each element will help you identify topics when reading other historians’ work. Not every source you read will follow that sentence structure, not even close, but in every good argument those three elements should be present in some form. I’ll also highlight any names or works that I recognize to draw connections when I put my notes into Obsidian (a note-taking software). Each book I’ve read has its own page on Obsidian where I keep a quick summary, notes about the author, and tags for each theme to tie the different pages together.</p>
