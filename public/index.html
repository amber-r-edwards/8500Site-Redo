I am from Louisville, KY and attended Centre College in Danville, KY where I found my passion for history and studying women, gender, and sexuality. I was also introduced to digital history methods and oral history practices – interacting with the Centre and local Danville communities for campus projects. In 2022 I graduated with a dual major Bachelor of Arts in History and French. After graduation I moved to Greenville, SC and worked as a Technical Recruiter before returning to school to continue pursuing a career as a Historian!">

<h4 id="about-me">About Me</h4>
<p>My name is Amber Edwards and I am a first year Digital History PhD student at Clemson University, studying 20th Century American History with a concentration in Women, Gender, and Sexuality.</p>
<p>I am from Louisville, KY and attended Centre College in Danville, KY where I found my passion for history and studying women, gender, and sexuality. I was also introduced to digital history methods and oral history practices – interacting with the Centre and local Danville communities for campus projects. In 2022 I graduated with a dual major Bachelor of Arts in History and French. After graduation I moved to Greenville, SC and worked as a Technical Recruiter before returning to school to continue pursuing a career as a Historian!</p>
<p>I’m interested in studying the emergence of Women’s Liberation and the Sexual Revolution and their impact on American culture and mass media – cultural impacts of the music industry and Rock ‘n’ Roll specifically being a key research interest of mine.</p>
<p>Currently I am a graduate teaching assistant, working with Dr. Andrew Baker in U.S. History to 1877.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-reach-me">How to Reach Me</h4>
<p>I am most active on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-edwards-82135b231/">LinkedIn</a> though I do currently have an active <a href="https://amberedwards.net/">WordPress</a> with a compilation of blog posts - primarily created for HIST8010 - some of which have been transferred here. I also have a <a href="https://github.com/amber-r-edwards">GitHub</a> with basic repositories and work for HIST8500.</p>
<p>My office hours for undergraduate students are listed on the course syllabus. Unless otherwise stated, all office hours are held in person in the History Department Graduate Office - Hardin Hall 001.</p>
