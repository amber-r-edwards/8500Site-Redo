      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/GreatMeadow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cover of The Great Meadow, by Brian Donahue&#34; style=&#34;width:200px; float:left&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week we’re looking at reviews, for which I chose a book for my Spatial History class, The Great Meadow: Farmers and the Land in Colonial Concord. Having already reviewed this work in contrast with corresponding articles and digital projects, I was curious to see what other thought of it closer to the time it came out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found the work well constructed, and a pivotal development in spatial history as it pertains to using digital methods that allow the natural environment to have a voice in its own historical narrative.Similar to incorporating the voices of marginalized groups, by including the ecological development of the land itself Donahue was able to construct a thorough and convincing argument that English settlers maintained sustainable mixed husbandry practices for generations before a gradual slip into exhaustive use of the land took over in alignment with growing population and market demands. This is contrary to the common historical narrative aided by the Transcendentalists of the early colonies as having destroyed the land in original settlements before expanding west and continuing the practice – and was made possible by mapping patters and cycles of land use via GIS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, in correlation with Clemson’s Humanities in the Machine Symposium, we’re looking at JSTOR’s beta AI tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The article I chose to analyze is “Sex and the Me Decade: Sex and Dating Advice Literature of the 1970s” by Anna Ward in &lt;em&gt;Women’s Studies Quarterly&lt;/em&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;first-i-asked-it-to-summarize-the-article-for-me&#34;&gt;First, I asked it to summarize the article for me:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Here’s a summary: The 1970s saw a significant shift in sex and dating advice literature, moving away from the promotion of healthy marriages towards a focus on personal sexual satisfaction and self-exploration as critical to identity formation.&#xA;Feminist and LGBTQ debates and activism heavily influenced this shift, reframing sex and sexuality as fundamentally political and challenging traditional prescriptions around gender and sexual norms.&#xA;Advice manuals increasingly framed sexuality as a means of self-expression and authenticity, with the rise of psychology-based “sex therapy” approaches encouraging women to view sexual fulfillment as a path to empowerment in other areas of life.&#xA;While the 1970s advice literature was overwhelmingly focused on a white, middle-class audience, it nonetheless represented a notable shift towards greater diversity in sexual discourse and recognition of a broad range of sexual desires and needs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RE1-Collecting Information</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note taking is one of the most important research tools, and the first step to writing a successful argument for any length of paper. My note taking style revolves around summarizing topics and arguments as well as catching any recurring themes that may be helpful to my research aims. Turabian’s Manual for Writers breaks down what research is, how we should think of it, and how to conduct it properly in order to best articulate our argument. The topic sentence breakdown of &amp;ldquo;I am working on X because I want to find out Y, so that I can help others understand Z” is something foundational that is taught in high schools and undergrad, but understanding each element will help you identify topics when reading other historians’ work. Not every source you read will follow that sentence structure, not even close, but in every good argument those three elements should be present in some form. I’ll also highlight any names or works that I recognize to draw connections when I put my notes into Obsidian (a note-taking software). Each book I’ve read has its own page on Obsidian where I keep a quick summary, notes about the author, and tags for each theme to tie the different pages together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Amber Edwards and I am a first year Digital History PhD student at Clemson University, studying 20th Century American History with a concentration in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. I’m interested in studying the emergence of Women’s Liberation and the Sexual Revolution and their impact on American culture and mass media – cultural impacts of the music industry and Rock ‘n’ Roll specifically being a key research interest of mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If doing research is a car, analysis is the oil or the gas – you technically have a car without it, but it isn’t really worth anything or useful to take you anywhere. These exercises contributed to the overall ‘professionalization’ goal of this course/program more broadly, and inform how to engage with other historians and scholarship. Without being able to read other analyses with a critical eye, discern fact from argumentation, and – particularly for my aims – consider digital projects and their unique contributions, there isn’t a well rounded goal to working with sources or creating visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Each year is separated into a separate layer - able to be toggled on and off to hide/reveal overlapping venues (especially relevant to early concerts in San Francisco).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sources</title>
      <link>https://example.com/hist8010/sources/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding sources, we covered how to collect information through note taking, verifying information through citations – and multiple software applications to streamline those processes and make compiling and saving large amounts of data easier and safer. Conceptually, I came into this semester feeling I had a decent handle on what worked for me regarding note taking and research approaches. While that may have been true, what I didn’t realize was the variety of tools available meant explicitly to make my life easier, and the skills required for engaging with sources that I simply had not been exposed to coming from a 2 year break from academia after undergrad.In the following sections, I’ll elaborate on how my practices have changed since making earlier posts, and some reflections on what I find most useful going forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visualization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visualizations, certainly the most entertaining, led to the most thoughtful consideration about where my research interests align with digital work.Having some experience with online exhibits through Omeka, Storymaps, and general presentation experience that pulled in different visualizations adjacent to those we covered, I found myself surprised at the novelty some of the tools’ utility for different projects.While I’ll analyze my usage of these tools from a current perspective, I’m especially interested in reflecting on how I see visualization tools differently from the thought process of looking toward an eventual dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
