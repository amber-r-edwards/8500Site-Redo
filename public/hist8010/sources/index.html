<h2 id="re1---collecting-sourcespostsre1"><a href="/posts/re1/">RE1 - Collecting Sources</a></h2>
<p>I still stand by my claim from this post that note taking is one of the most important research tools and the foundation to a successful project. Upon writing this blog post I did utilize Obsidian, however I was not using it to its full capacity, or intentionally enough to be truly useful for me. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll also highlight any names or works that I recognize to draw connections when I put my notes into Obsidian (a note-taking software). Each book I’ve read has its own page on Obsidian where I keep a quick summary, notes about the author, and tags for each theme to tie the different pages together.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back, I was not looking in the right places for connections between works or being nearly intentionally detailed enough for the notes to continue to be relevant. What I mean by intentionally relevant is that I was focusing on very surface level summaries and connections rather than analyzing the structure of the work itself, how it fits within its respective historiography, or what sources it pulls heavily from that I may want to add to my own reading list.</p>
