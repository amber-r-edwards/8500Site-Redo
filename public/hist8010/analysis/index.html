<h2 id="re6---critical-readingsspostsre6"><a href="/posts/re6/">RE6 - Critical Readings(s)</a></h2>
<p>While I certainly had experience with critical reading, I did not have as much experience considering reviews prior to graduate school. During undergrad, I saw reviews as falling under the same category of reading Sparknotes or a summary instead of actually doing readings for class – which it certainly still can be – not as a key part of professional history. Adding reviews into my process of reading has been a huge takeaway of this semester as a whole – and immensely helpful for getting accustomed to seeing connections within historiography. Reviews provide examples of how a work was received, where it fits into existing scholarship, and direct toward further reading along the same – or opposing – lines of argumentation.</p>
<p>Having chosen a book I was already reading and writing my own review on for another class, <em>The Great Meadow</em> by Brian Donahue, this exercise helped me articulate my own thoughts and compare my reactions to that of other historians (and a few geographers). Interestingly, I consider their perspectives and arguments in relation to my own, but did not elaborate on my own arguments in any specific manner. I stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I found the work well constructed, and a pivotal development in spatial history as it pertains to using digital methods that allow the natural environment to have a voice in its own historical narrative. Similar to incorporating the voices of marginalized groups, by including the ecological development of the land itself Donahue was able to construct a thorough and convincing argument that English settlers maintained sustainable mixed husbandry practices for generations before a gradual slip into exhaustive use of the land took over in alignment with growing population and market demands. This is contrary to the common historical narrative aided by the Transcendentalists of the early colonies as having destroyed the land in original settlements before expanding west and continuing the practice – and was made possible by mapping patters and cycles of land use via GIS.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I did not include is my own critique of Donahues assessment of women within the text – which is superficial at best and exploitative at worst.His argument is framed around the establishment of different spaces within the landscape of colonial Concord that worked in tandem to generate a more successful system of mixed husbandry than is typically ascribed to colonial settlers.However, one of these spaces is the home and gardens which women were largely confined to.Making a concession in the preface that he will not consider women within his study, he goes on to continuously refer to the importance of the familial structures of the homesteads and settlers throughout the book – particularly in the case of generational heritage.The excuse of excluding women based on source material is not only antiquated but is ill placed given the fact that without women there would simply be no children for generational heritage, and the colonies would not be stabilized as communities at all.</p>
<p>In my blog post, I make this comment in passing and focus on the statements of the reviewers as considering the generational focus of the work as a novel framing.I still very strongly stand by my critique of the treatment of women in this book – despite how well supported and interesting it is as a whole – and see the glazing over of my own opinion as a part of my own process in finding my voice this semester.Something engaging with critical reading and discussion offers a historian is an ability to confidently articulate their own thoughts within the context of others who may or may not agree, which sounds straight forward but is a skill in itself to learn to see one’s own opinion as valid within scholarship – if you don’t, who will?</p>
