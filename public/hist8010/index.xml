      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&#xA;    &lt;head&gt;&#xA;        &lt;title&gt;Sources&lt;/title&gt;&#xA;        &lt;date&gt;Dec 3, 2024&lt;/date&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/head&gt;&#xA;    &lt;body&gt;&#xA;        &lt;h1&gt;Sources&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;        &lt;p&gt;Regarding sources, we covered how to collect information through note taking, verifying information through citations – and multiple software applications to streamline those processes and make compiling and saving large amounts of data easier and safer. &#xA;            Conceptually, I came into this semester feeling I had a decent handle on what worked for me regarding note taking and research approaches.&#xA;             While that may have been true, what I didn’t realize was the variety of tools available meant explicitly to make my life easier, and the skills required for engaging with sources that I simply had not been exposed to coming from a 2 year break from academia after undergrad.&#xA;             In the following sections, I’ll elaborate on how my practices have changed since making earlier posts, and some reflections on what I find most useful going forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&#xA;&lt;html&gt;&#xA;    &lt;head&gt;&#xA;        &lt;title&gt;Visualization&lt;/title&gt;&#xA;        &lt;date&gt;Dec 2, 2024&lt;/date&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/head&gt;&#xA;    &lt;body&gt;&#xA;        &lt;h1&gt;Visualization&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;        &lt;p&gt;Visualizations, certainly the most entertaining, led to the most thoughtful consideration about where my research interests align with digital work.&#xA;             Having some experience with online exhibits through Omeka, Storymaps, and general presentation experience that pulled in different visualizations adjacent to those we covered, I found myself surprised at the novelty some of the tools’ utility for different projects.&#xA;             While I’ll analyze my usage of these tools from a current perspective, I’m especially interested in reflecting on how I see visualization tools differently from the thought process of looking toward an eventual dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If doing research is a car, analysis is the oil or the gas – you technically have a car without it, but it isn’t really worth anything or useful to take you anywhere. These exercises contributed to the overall ‘professionalization’ goal of this course/program more broadly, and inform how to engage with other historians and scholarship. Without being able to read other analyses with a critical eye, discern fact from argumentation, and – particularly for my aims – consider digital projects and their unique contributions, there isn’t a well rounded goal to working with sources or creating visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
