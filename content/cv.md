**A History of Gender at Centre College**, “Social Life and Women on Centre’s Campus” (Spring 2021) https://womenatcentre.omeka.net/exhibits/show/gender-at-centre/social-life/social-life-women 
- I created an exhibit on Omeka for Centre College’s Digital Archive after interviewing alumni who had attended during the period of gender integration – Centre was a male-only college until 1926, and campus until 1962.
- I explored the nature of social life on Centre’s campus from the time residential students of Kentucky College for Women moved into residence halls on Centre’s campus in the 1960s to the introduction of sororities on campus in the 1980s, in order to illustrate the development of social spaces for women within the male-dominated campus.
