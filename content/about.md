## Summary
My name is Amber Edwards and I am a first year Digital History PhD student at Clemson University, studying 20th Century American History with a concentration in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. I’m interested in studying the emergence of Women’s Liberation and the Sexual Revolution and their impact on American culture and mass media – cultural impacts of the music industry and Rock ‘n’ Roll specifically being a key research interest of mine.

Currently I am also a graduate teaching assistant, working with Dr. James Jeffries in U.S. History to 1877.


I am from Louisville, KY and attended Centre College in Danville, KY where I found my passion for Social History and studying women, gender, and sexuality. I was also introduced to digital history methods and oral history practices – interacting with the Centre and local Danville communities for campus projects. In 2022 I graduated with a dual major Bachelor of Arts in History and French. After graduation I moved to Greenville, SC to work in IT Staffing before returning to school to continue pursuing a career as a Historian!
