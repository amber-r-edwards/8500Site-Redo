title: HIST 8010 Research Skills and Design Tools
---

This is a sample from a portfolio of assignments from HIST 8010: Historical Thinking and Digital Research. Originally compiled into a WordPress website, blog posts are categorized into "Sources," "Visualization," and "Analysis" and include a reflection written at the end of the semester looking back on what could have been improved in the original posts. One from each section have been reposted here with their original dates and content.
