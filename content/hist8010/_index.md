This is a portfolio of assignments from HIST 8010 - Historical Thinking and Digital Research. 
Originally compiled into a WordPress website, the blog posts are categorized into "Sources," "Visualization," and "Analysis" and include a reflection written at the end of the semester looking back on what could have been improved in the original posts. A sample have been reposted here with their original dates and content.
