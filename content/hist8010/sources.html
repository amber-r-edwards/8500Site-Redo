        <h1>Sources</h1>
        <p>Regarding sources, we covered how to collect information through note taking, verifying information through citations – and multiple software applications to streamline those processes and make compiling and saving large amounts of data easier and safer. 
            Conceptually, I came into this semester feeling I had a decent handle on what worked for me regarding note taking and research approaches.
             While that may have been true, what I didn’t realize was the variety of tools available meant explicitly to make my life easier, and the skills required for engaging with sources that I simply had not been exposed to coming from a 2 year break from academia after undergrad.
             In the following sections, I’ll elaborate on how my practices have changed since making earlier posts, and some reflections on what I find most useful going forward.</p>

        <p>I still stand by my claim from this post that note taking is one of the most important research tools and the foundation to a successful project. 
            Upon writing this blog post I did utilize Obsidian, however I was not using it to its full capacity, or intentionally enough to be truly useful for me. 
            I wrote:</p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>"I’ll also highlight any names or works that I recognize to draw connections when I put my notes into Obsidian (a note-taking software). 
                Each book I’ve read has its own page on Obsidian where I keep a quick summary, notes about the author, and tags for each theme to tie the different pages together."</blockquote>
            <br>
        <p>Looking back, I was not looking in the right places for connections between works or being nearly intentionally detailed enough for the notes to continue to be relevant. 
            What I mean by intentionally relevant is that I was focusing on very surface level summaries and connections rather than analyzing the structure of the work itself, how it fits within its respective historiography, or what sources it pulls heavily from that I may want to add to my own reading list.</p>
