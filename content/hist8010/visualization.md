Visualizations, certainly the most entertaining, led to the most thoughtful consideration about where my research interests align with digital work.Having some experience with online exhibits through Omeka, Storymaps, and general presentation experience that pulled in different visualizations adjacent to those we covered, I found myself surprised at the novelty some of the tools’ utility for different projects.While I’ll analyze my usage of these tools from a current perspective, I’m especially interested in reflecting on how I see visualization tools differently from the thought process of looking toward an eventual dissertation.

## [RE5 - The Impact of the AI Revolution on Information Archives](/posts/re5)

JSTOR AI is the tool I am the least likely to use for a variety of reasons, though our research exercise examining its effectiveness was enlightening.As a beta tool, it has a few different functions that center around summarizing and answering basic questions about the contents of articles – able to provide somewhat limited answers to open ended questions. I had used AI for summarizing a handful of times before – as well as productive AI like ChatGPT during my time as a recruiter (ChatGPT can reformat a resume beautifully in a pinch) – but I had not considered using it for graduate readings before this exercise.

Because of how common AI summarizing tools have become – social media, Google, and even Adobe have their own versions – there wasn’t necessarily a learning curve here, but it did lead to an interesting consideration of close vs distant reading. When working on something we’re interested in studying, the historian’s impulse is to what to soak up every detail of everything but – especially in this day and age – that’s simply impossible because of the volume of sources out there. I think JSTOR’s recognition of this development and attempt to help solve the issue shows its focus on its academic audience and a desire to stay relevant – not that it ever wouldn’t be at this point – but I remain unconvinced. Perhaps because of my own distrust, but also resulting from poor OCR or scanned images of texts, JSTOR AI does not yet seem reliable enough to replace doing my own distant reading of the article before considering my next steps. This paired with the environmental quandaries of using AI to any capacity doesn’t entice me to use it to any high frequency.

I do, however, understand the appeal to understand how to use AI summaries – even faulty ones – to your advantage when sifting through thousands of articles in working on a large project. As mentioned before, JSTOR certainly has recognized a growing problem for professional historians and I applaud the attempt to resolve it, however I’m unsure there is one hard and fast solution to the problem of growing scholarship and relatively stagnant human capacity for reading in a given timespan.
