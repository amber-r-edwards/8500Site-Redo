#### About Me
My name is Amber Edwards and I am a first year Digital History PhD student at Clemson University, studying 20th Century American History with a concentration in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. 

I am from Louisville, KY and attended Centre College in Danville, KY where I found my passion for history and studying women, gender, and sexuality. I was also introduced to digital history methods and oral history practices – interacting with the Centre and local Danville communities for campus projects. In 2022 I graduated with a dual major Bachelor of Arts in History and French. After graduation I moved to Greenville, SC and worked as a Technical Recruiter before returning to school to continue pursuing a career as a Historian!

I’m interested in studying the emergence of Women’s Liberation and the Sexual Revolution and their impact on American culture and mass media – cultural impacts of the music industry and Rock ‘n’ Roll specifically being a key research interest of mine. 

Currently I am a graduate teaching assistant, working with Dr. Andrew Baker in U.S. History to 1877.

#### Research
My current research project is focused on underground publications - zines - from women’s liberation groups in the 1960s and 70s, seeking to explore the knowledge-sharing network between organizations and the reproduction of radical feminist ideology and gendered language using digital methods. Looking at “It Ain’t Me Babe,” a zine originating at UC Berkeley before expanding to a nationwide audience, I’ve found that not only is there a use of larger news services such as LNS (Liberation News Service), but there is extensive reprinting and plugging of other underground zines – though the direct citations and formatting are inconsistent. By constructing a dataset based around a controlled vocabulary highlighting events and resources, I’d like to use computational textual analysis to visualize the relationship between print culture and feminist organizing that highlights underground and grassroots knowledge sharing as critical labor to create a network of feminisms. Aligning with the broader historiography of radical feminism and the counterculture, exploring the subculture of print publications providing spaces for thought, creativity, and radical communication highlights the tradition of zines as a feminist tool for community building that resurges with 90s riot grrl and ‘third wave’ feminism. This project centers principles of data feminism by seeking to highlight the power of knowledge sharing among local organizations, informing a radical feminism that embraced diverse lived experiences of “Sisters in Struggle” (language from “It Ain’t Me Babe).
