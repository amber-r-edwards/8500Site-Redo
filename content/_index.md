#### About Me
My name is Amber Edwards and I am a first year Digital History PhD student at Clemson University, studying 20th Century American History with a concentration in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. 

I am from Louisville, KY and attended Centre College in Danville, KY where I found my passion for history and studying women, gender, and sexuality. I was also introduced to digital history methods and oral history practices – interacting with the Centre and local Danville communities for campus projects. In 2022 I graduated with a dual major Bachelor of Arts in History and French. After graduation I moved to Greenville, SC and worked as a Technical Recruiter before returning to school to continue pursuing a career as a Historian!

I’m interested in studying the emergence of Women’s Liberation and the Sexual Revolution and their impact on American culture and mass media – cultural impacts of the music industry and Rock ‘n’ Roll specifically being a key research interest of mine. 

Currently I am a graduate teaching assistant, working with Dr. Andrew Baker in U.S. History to 1877.
