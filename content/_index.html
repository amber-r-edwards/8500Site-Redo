            <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>

              <p>My name is Amber Edwards and I am a first year Digital History PhD student at Clemson University, studying 20th Century American History with a concentration in Women, Gender, and Sexuality. 
                I’m interested in studying the emergence of Women’s Liberation and the Sexual Revolution and their impact on American culture and mass media – cultural impacts of the music industry and Rock ‘n’ Roll specifically being a key research interest of mine.</p>
            
                <p>Currently I am also a graduate teaching assistant, working with Dr. Andrew Baker in U.S. History to 1877.</p>

                <p>I am from Louisville, KY and attended Centre College in Danville, KY where I found my passion for social history and studying women, gender, and sexuality. 
                I was also introduced to digital history methods and oral history practices – interacting with the Centre and local Danville communities for campus projects. 
                In 2022 I graduated with a dual major Bachelor of Arts in History and French. 
                After graduation I moved to Greenville, SC to work in IT Staffing before returning to school to continue pursuing a career as a Historian!</p>
