Created alongside a project proposal for HIST 8540 - Spatial History, this map displays the locations of Janis Joplin and Jefferson Airplane's concerts over 1966-1970. Each year is separated into a separate layer - able to be toggled on and off to hide/reveal overlapping venues (especially relevant to early concerts in San Francisco).
 
A spatial analysis of the imagined place of San Francisco could centralize the counterculture in the historical memory of the 1960s by emphasizing the role San Francisco played in creating and dispersing the music and cultural iconography that continues to be associated with the decade at large.

Part of the HIST 8010 Research Skills and Digital Tools Portfolio, this is a Timeline.JS experiment of various events that define The Sixties - capped at 1963.

The idea for this timeline was born of a term paper synthesizing the historiography of monographs covering the 1960s. Seeing that a central tension was how the social movements and events chosen by the author led to prioritization of certain perspectives over others assigned to the periphery - often the women's and gay rights movements and the counterculture - I was curious to see how compiling as many events as I could find/think of would shape a timeline.

I created an exhibit on Omeka for Centre College's Digital Archive after interviewing alumni who had attended during the period of gender integration â€“ Centre was a male-only college until 1926, and campus until 1962.

I explored the nature of social life on Centre's campus from the time residential students of Kentucky College for Women moved into residence halls on Centre's campus in the 1960s to the introduction of sororities on campus in the 1980s, in order to illustrate the development of social spaces for women within the male-dominated campus.
